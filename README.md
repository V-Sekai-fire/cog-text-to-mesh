Currently, this project is in the **Sandbox** phase, which is the initial stage of a project according to the V-Sekai maturity model.

The V-Sekai maturity model consists of three stages:

1. **Sandbox**: This stage serves as the starting point for projects, aiming to nurture innovation and project development.
2. **Incubating**: At this stage, projects are on their journey towards graduation, with an expectation of having a stable codebase and well-structured formation.
3. **Graduated**: These projects have reached maturity, adopting best practices and catering to a broad user base.

As the project fulfills the criteria laid out by V-Sekai, it will progress through these stages.
